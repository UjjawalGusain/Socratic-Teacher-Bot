// 1. Diagnostic Prompts (5-7)
// These prompts help assess the student's current understanding of a concept or algorithm. You will need a few variations depending on the specific topic being covered (e.g., time complexity, sorting algorithms).
// Example Prompts:
// "What is your understanding of the time complexity for sorting algorithms?"
// "Can you explain how Merge Sort works?"
// "What are the differences between Quick Sort and Bubble Sort?"
// "How do you handle edge cases in sorting algorithms?"


// 2. Probing Prompts (10-12)
// These prompts push the student to think more critically and deeply about their answers, without giving away the solution. They help the assistant guide the student through a problem.

// Example Prompts:
// "What happens to the performance of your algorithm when the input size increases?"
// "How does the time complexity of Merge Sort compare to Quick Sort for large datasets?"
// "Is your algorithm stable? Can you think of any cases where stability might be important?"
// "Why do you think this test case timed out while others passed?"



// 3. Clarification Prompts (5-7)
// These are used to confirm or clarify a student's understanding or response. The assistant can use these to make sure the student is on the right track or to gently redirect their focus.

// Example Prompts:
// "So, you're saying that Quick Sort is faster than Merge Sort in most cases, right?"
// "Can you walk me through why you think this solution is O(n log n)?"
// "Just to clarify, what is the base case for this recursive function?"



// 4. Reflective Prompts (5-7)
// These prompts encourage students to think about their own thought processes and past decisions. These can help them see patterns or mistakes on their own.

// Example Prompts:
// "Looking back, what would you do differently with this approach?"
// "How does this solution compare to others you've tried?"
// "Can you identify any patterns in the mistakes you made?"



// 5. Follow-up Prompts (10-15)
// After receiving an answer from the student, these prompts continue the dialogue based on the student's responses, ensuring that the conversation progresses logically.

// Example Prompts:
// "If your current algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), how could you optimize it?"
// "What happens if the input array is already sorted? Can you think of an algorithm that performs better in that case?"
// "You mentioned recursionâ€”how would that impact the memory usage in your implementation?"



// 6. Hints/Guiding Prompts (10-12)
// These prompts offer subtle hints to guide the student toward the right answer without directly solving the problem for them.

// Example Prompts:
// "What do you think would happen if you used a divide-and-conquer strategy?"
// "What role does pivot selection play in Quick Sort's efficiency?"
// "Have you considered the worst-case scenario for this algorithm?"



// 7. Challenge Prompts (3-5)
// Once the student has a good understanding, you can challenge them to tackle a more complex or advanced scenario.

// Example Prompts:
// "Can you modify your Merge Sort implementation to handle a linked list instead of an array?"
// "What if you wanted to sort in descending order? How would you modify your current algorithm?"
// "How would you optimize this for real-time applications with constantly changing data?"



// 8. Reinforcement Prompts (5-7)
// These prompts help reinforce key concepts after the student has arrived at the correct solution.

// Example Prompts:
// "Why is it important to understand the time complexity of sorting algorithms?"
// "How does understanding algorithm efficiency help you in real-world applications?"
// "What is the main takeaway from this lesson on sorting?"
// Total Number of Prompts
// Diagnostic Prompts: 5-7
// Probing Prompts: 10-12
// Clarification Prompts: 5-7
// Reflective Prompts: 5-7
// Follow-up Prompts: 10-15
// Hints/Guiding Prompts: 10-12
// Challenge Prompts: 3-5
// Reinforcement Prompts: 5-7
// Approximate Total: 53-72 Prompts
// This range allows for flexible, dynamic conversation flows. The prompts can be tailored based on the subtopic of Data Structures and Algorithms you focus on (e.g., sorting algorithms).
